  What is mongoose.Schema?

In Mongoose (a popular MongoDB ODM library for Node.js),

Schema is a blueprint or structure that defines the shape of the documents inside a MongoDB collection.

It describes what fields (keys) a document should have, their types, and optionally their rules/validations (like required, default values, min/max, enums, etc.).


Why use Schema?

Because MongoDB is schemaless by default, you can insert any shape of document.
But in a real application, we need structure and consistency.
Mongoose Schema helps enforce that and provides extra features like:

Validation

Middleware (pre/post hooks)

Virtuals (computed properties)

Indexes



Object Data Modeling (ODM): Mongoose maps MongoDB documents to JavaScript objects, making it more intuitive to work with your data in a Node.
js environment. 
You can interact with your data using familiar JavaScript object methods and properties.
